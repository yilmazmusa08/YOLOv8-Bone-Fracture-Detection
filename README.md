Uses 

Intended Use: 

Assist radiologists and orthopedic surgeons in the detection and diagnosis of bone fractures and abnormalities in X-ray images. 

Aid in treatment planning by providing accurate localization and identification of fractures, implants, and other pathologies. 

Educational purposes to train medical students and residents in the interpretation of X-ray images. 

 

Out-of-Scope Use: 

Unauthorized surveillance or invasion of privacy. 

Non-medical purposes. 

 

Ethical Considerations: 

Data Bias: Model performance might vary depending on the diversity and representativeness of the training data. 

Privacy Concerns: X-ray images might contain sensitive patient information. 

Misuse Potential: Risk of misuse if the model is used for unauthorized purposes.
